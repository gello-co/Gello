Alternative actions/options discussed:

For this meeting we discussed how to implement the Trello API into the project. We discussed:
- Using our application as a Trello add-on where tasks could be updated from either end
- Either using Trello as a backend, therefore only allowing actions from our application
- Creating an isolated project with our own database and without the Trello API

<!-- required -->

Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities:

- For next week, make a decision between using Trello API as a database or creating an isolated application.
- Begin creating the project with the goal of having the ability to show the project. Implement basic features such as making/deleting projects, displaying different pages for different users, etc.
- Start working on authentication only if we have time, however, not a requirement.
